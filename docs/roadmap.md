- **Cloud data integration**: Direct access to cloud-hosted datasets (AWS, Google Cloud)
- **Data validation tools**: Enhanced quality control and validation functionality
- **Metadata standardization**: Implement CF-compliant metadata handling

### Visualization

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Develop Plotly/Dash-based interactive visualizations for dynamic exploration of drought data, including heatmaps and time series plots in `sswei_class.py` and `drought_analysis.py`, with features like zooming, tooltips, and data filtering.
- **GIS integration**: Better integration with GIS tools (QGIS, ArcGIS)
- **Custom plotting themes**: Themed visualizations for publications and presentations
- **Animation capabilities**: Time-series animations of drought evolution

## Long-Term Goals (1-2 years)

### Ecosystem Expansion

- **Web Application**: Create a web-based interface for non-technical users
- **Professional Website**: Develop a comprehensive public website similar to HydroSHEDS (https://www.hydrosheds.org/) to serve as the primary online presence for the Snow Drought Index project. The website will feature interactive data visualizations, detailed documentation, downloadable datasets, user guides, case studies, and a portal for community engagement, aiming to increase visibility and accessibility for researchers, policymakers, and the public.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a simplified mobile interface for field researchers
- **Plugin System**: Architecture for community-contributed extensions

### Advanced Analytics

- **Causal analysis**: Tools for identifying drivers of snow drought events
- **Teleconnection analysis**: Integration with climate indices (ENSO, PDO, etc.)
- **Extreme event attribution**: Methods for attributing drought events to climate change
- **Ensemble forecasting**: Support for ensemble-based seasonal forecasting

### Community Building

- **User forum**: Establish a dedicated user forum or discussion board
